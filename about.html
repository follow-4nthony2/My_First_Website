    <h2>Hobbies and Interests!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I like computers and learning about them although I will "mess around" I am learning which is the point of this class. I am here to learn and I do like to figure out things on my own.</li>
        <li>I am usually friendly, although I do lose respect those few people that make it on my bad side.</li>
        <li>I enjoy doing "tricks" and doing cool things before everyone knows how to do it, kind of the better version of how everyone knows how to rotate the screen on the computer.</li>
        <li>For some reason everyone thinks I have bad grades, but I do have good grades and I hope to have straight A's by the end of this quarter</li>
